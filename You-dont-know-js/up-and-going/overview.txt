Coercion: conversion of type of a value.
* Explicit
* Implicit

Javascript has typed values, not typed variables.
Typeof is not asking for “type of a”; but rather for the “type of value currently in a ”

Exception:
	var a = null;
	typeof a.  // “object” 

== checks for value equality with coercion allowed
=== checks for value equality without allowing coercion (strict equality)

Avoid == or != in cases
* Either value can be boolean (true or false)
* Either value is the specific value (0, “”, [])
In rest other cases it is safe to use ==.
